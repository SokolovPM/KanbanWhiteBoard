# KanbanWhiteBoard
This is a simple Kanban board implementation to use for small or private projects when there are no many participants in the team. Simple design and ease of use help you create tasks fast without many useless steps and useless info. You see only that you need to see - description of task, executor and a priority. 

You can create a project just for yourself or invite some people to join you. You could be invited in some project - in this case you get an email (if you are not registered) or you will see the new project in your project list.

You can create a project for everything when you need to keep set of tasks
- you want to run a small startup with friends
- you want to plan the trip and don't want to forget something
- you want to write a historical novel and you need to read dozens of articles and books
